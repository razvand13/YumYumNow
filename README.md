# Orders Microservice for team-14a

This project contains the implementation of the Orders Microservice for YumYumNow of team 14a.

YumYumNow is a food delivery application that connects customers, vendors and couriers. We are responsible for creating the microservice that handles the CRUD functionality for orders and dishes, allowing customers to order certain dishes from specific vendors.

This application simulates authorization by sending GET requests to the Users Microservice, for specific roles with specific id's.
